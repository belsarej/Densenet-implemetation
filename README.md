# Densenet-implemetation
Densenet  implementation
A PyTorch Implementation for Densely Connected Convolutional Networks (DenseNets)

This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of the paper Densely Connected Convolutional Networks with Growth Rate =12 and Layers = 100.

DenseNet-BC(k=12,L=100)
The No of Parameters in this Model is around 0.8 M which makes it easy to train and requires lesser computational power

This repo consists of:

Different Data Augmentation we used in our experiments in data augmentation.ipynb
DenseNet Excel file has the Expermentitonal Results
We have build two different models one DenseNet-BC(k=12,L=100) which is in Final Densenet implemetation and 
Another in densenet 121 with  1 Millon parameter in Densenet(1) file
Data augmenation file contain different augmentation techniques
