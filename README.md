# Densenet-implemetation
Densenet  implementation
A PyTorch Implementation for Densely Connected Convolutional Networks (DenseNets)

This repo consists of:

Different Data Augmentation we used in our experiments in data augmentation.ipynb
DenseNet Excel file has the Expermentitonal Results

We have build two different models one DenseNet-BC(k=12,L=100) which is in Final Densenet implemetation 

Another in densenet 121 with  1 Millon parameter in Densenet(1) file

Data augmenation file contain different augmentation techniques
